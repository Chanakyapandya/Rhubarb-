Rhubarb is a vegetable used to make many delicious things 

we will be making Ice-cream From the Rhubarb 

Rhubarb makes a fabulous ice cream flavor because of its natural tartness.


Rhubarb is famously tangy, and that actually helps the flavor shine through in this creamy ice cream (you can taste a similar effect in my fresh lemon ice cream). The perfect soft pink color comes from several stalks of rhubarb sliced and cooked down into a thick compote, it takes just a few minutes on the stove. After chilling I fold into a classic vanilla custard ice cream base. It churns up into the prettiest summer ice cream you’ve ever seen. Oh, and definitely steal a taste while it’s churning, that’s one of the best perks of making your own.

Instructions

Stir together the rhubarb, sugar, lemon juice, and a splash of water in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Let cook for about 15 minutes, stirring often, until some of the liquid has evaporated and the rhubarb is thick and soft. Be careful not to let it scorch on the bottom of your pan.


Let the compote cool slightly then puree in a blender or food processor until completely smooth. Chill until cold.


Meanwhile make the custard. Whisk the egg, yolks, sugar, and milk, making sure to break up the eggs 
completely. Heat the cream in a medium heavy bottomed saucepan until it starts to steam and gets little bubbles around the edge.

 Drizzle the hot cream into the egg mixture, whisking constantly. Pour the whole thing back into the pan and heat on medium, stirring constantly, until the mixture just starts to thicken. Do not bring it to a boil.


Strain the mixture through a sieve, stir in the vanilla, and let cool. Chill until cold.
Mix the cold rhubarb with the cold custard sauce and thoroughly blend. Pour into your ice cream maker and churn according to the instructions. Spread the soft ice cream into a container and freeze until scoopable.
